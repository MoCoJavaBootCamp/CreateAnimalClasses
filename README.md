# Create Animal Classes

Four new animals were created using the Animal Class.

Each animal inherited sleep and sleep methods from its parent class, but were modified.

The encapsulation isn't very strong due to no private variables.

However, methods were overridden to cater to the exact subclass.

This is called polymorphism, where the subclass takes on a new form.
